### One-time Setup

```sh
# macOS command line tools
xcode-select --install

# Install via Homebrew
brew install node@20 watchman

# Install CocoaPods for iOS native deps
sudo gem install cocoapods

# Android environment variables (add to ~/.zshrc, then source ~/.zshrc)
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin:$PATH

# Verify Android tools
which adb && adb version
```

### Project-specific Setup

```sh
cd /Users/wuyanlin/Documents/SIGHTA-AI
npm install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

# Android/iOS Quick Start

## Prerequisites (one-time)
- macOS tools: `xcode-select --install`
- CocoaPods: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
- Node/Yarn/Watchman: `brew install node@20 yarn watchman`
- Android env (add to `~/.zshrc`, then `source ~/.zshrc`):
	```sh
	export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
	export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin:$PATH
	```
- Verify Android tools: `which adb && adb version`

yarn install
## Clone and install
```sh
cd /Users/wuyanlin/Documents/SIGHTA-AI
yarn install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..   # iOS native deps
```

## Start Metro (required before running iOS/Android)
```sh
# optional: free the port
lsof -nP -iTCP:8081 | awk 'NR>1{print $2}' | xargs -r kill -9

npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

## Run iOS
```sh
cd /Users/wuyanlin/Documents/SIGHTA-AI
npx react-native run-ios
```

## Run Android
```sh
emulator -list-avds             # see available AVDs
emulator -avd Pixel_9_Pro &     # start an AVD (replace name if different)
adb devices                     # confirm device listed
npx react-native run-android
```

## Clean/rebuild (when native deps change)
- iOS: `cd ios && pod install && cd .. && npx react-native run-ios`
- Android: `cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd .. && npx react-native run-android`

## Stop/exit
- Stop app: `adb shell am force-stop com.sightaai`
- Uninstall app: `adb uninstall com.sightaai`
- Stop emulator: `adb emu kill` (or close UI)
- Stop Metro: `Ctrl+C`

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

From the project root `/Users/wuyanlin/Documents/SIGHTA-AI`, start Metro (do this before running iOS/Android):

```sh
# optional: free port 8081
lsof -nP -iTCP:8081 | awk 'NR>1{print $2}' | xargs -r kill -9

npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
cd /Users/wuyanlin/Documents/SIGHTA-AI
npx react-native run-android
```

### iOS

If native deps change, run once: `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`

```sh
cd /Users/wuyanlin/Documents/SIGHTA-AI
npx react-native run-ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations!

You've successfully run and modified  React Native App. :partying_face:
